# 2. Build Foundational Skills
* Study basic programming and scripting: Python, Bash, PowerShell.
* Learn basic Linux usage and commands; get comfortable with terminal-based work.
* Practice networking with tools like Wireshark for packet analysis.
* Get familiar with virtualization tools like VirtualBox or VMware to create lab environments.  

# 3. Set Up a Lab Environment
* Install Kali Linux or Parrot OS for cybersecurity tools and practice.
* Set up vulnerable machines or use online platforms for practice (Metasploitable, DVWA).
* Use platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box to do real-world labs and challenges.  
 
# 4. Learn Core Cybersecurity Concepts
* Understand different types of attacks: phishing, XSS, SQL injection, malware types, ransomware.
* Study cryptography basics: symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, certificates.
* Learn about firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, VPNs, proxies.
* Know about authentication, authorization, and access control methods.  

# 5. Master Key Security Tools and Techniques
* Network scanning with Nmap.
* Vulnerability assessment and exploitation basics with Metasploit.
* Web application testing with Burp Suite.
* Traffic analysis with Wireshark.
* Intrusion detection with Snort or Suricata. 

# 6. Gain Hands-On Experience and Certifications
* Solve Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and real-world hacking labs.
* Participate in bug bounty programs and cybersecurity communities.
* Pursue beginner-to-intermediate certifications such as:
    * CompTIA Security+
    * Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
    * Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) (more advanced)  

# 7. Advanced Topics and Specializations
* Incident response and digital forensics.
* Malware analysis and reverse engineering.
* Cloud security (AWS, Azure, GCP security fundamentals).
* Threat hunting and SOC operations.
* Secure software development and DevSecOps.

# CTF Domains and Their Inclusions
Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are a fantastic way to practice cybersecurity skills across diverse domains. Here are common CTF domains and what they typically include:
| CTF Domain           | Description / What It Includes                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web Exploitation     | Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps, such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication flaws. |
| Binary Exploitation  | Reverse engineering, buffer overflows, format string attacks, heap exploits on compiled binaries.           |
| Cryptography         | Breaking or analyzing cryptographic challenges, cipher cracking, encoding/decoding messages.                |
| Reverse Engineering  | Analyzing compiled code to understand functionality or extract secrets without source code.                 |
| Forensics            | Analyzing files, network captures, memory dumps, or logs to find hidden data or reconstruct events.         |
| Steganography        | Finding hidden messages or data in images, audio, video, or other media files.                              |
| Network Exploitation | Capturing and analyzing network traffic, exploiting protocols, man-in-the-middle, or traffic tampering.     |
| Miscellaneous        | Unique challenges that do not fall strictly into other categories, including puzzles, OSINT, scripting.     |
