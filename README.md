# ROADMAP-Cybersecurity
ROADMAP to get started in cybersecurity

# 1. Understand the Basics of How Technology Works
* Learn how websites function: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
* Understand databases and basic backend concepts.
* Study how computer networks work: IP addressing, subnetting, routing, DNS, DHCP.
* Learn key internet protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, SMTP, FTP, SSL/TLS.
* Understand operating system fundamentals (Windows, Linux, macOS): file systems, processes, permissions, command line.  

# 2. Build Foundational Skills
* Study basic programming and scripting: Python, Bash, PowerShell.
* Learn basic Linux usage and commands; get comfortable with terminal-based work.
* Practice networking with tools like Wireshark for packet analysis.
* Get familiar with virtualization tools like VirtualBox or VMware to create lab environments.  

# 3. Set Up a Lab Environment
* Install Kali Linux or Parrot OS for cybersecurity tools and practice.
* Set up vulnerable machines or use online platforms for practice (Metasploitable, DVWA).
* Use platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box to do real-world labs and challenges.  
 
# 4. Learn Core Cybersecurity Concepts
* Understand different types of attacks: phishing, XSS, SQL injection, malware types, ransomware.
* Study cryptography basics: symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, certificates.
* Learn about firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, VPNs, proxies.
* Know about authentication, authorization, and access control methods.  

# 5. Master Key Security Tools and Techniques
* Network scanning with Nmap.
* Vulnerability assessment and exploitation basics with Metasploit.
* Web application testing with Burp Suite.
* Traffic analysis with Wireshark.
* Intrusion detection with Snort or Suricata. 

# 6. Gain Hands-On Experience and Certifications
* Solve Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and real-world hacking labs.
* Participate in bug bounty programs and cybersecurity communities.
* Pursue beginner-to-intermediate certifications such as:
    * CompTIA Security+
    * Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
    * Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) (more advanced)
